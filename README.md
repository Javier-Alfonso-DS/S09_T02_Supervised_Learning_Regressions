S09 T02: Supervised Learning - Regressions

Description
Let's practice and become familiar with regression.

Level 1

- Exercise 1

Create at least three different regression models to try to predict as well as possible the flight delay (ArrDelay) of DelayedFlights.csv.

- Exercise 2

Compare them on the basis of MSE and R2 .

- Exercise 3

Train them using the different parameters they allow.

- Exercise 4

Compare their performance using the test/train approach or using all data (internal validation).

Level 2

- Exercise 5

Perform some variable engineering process to improve your prediction.

Level 3

- Exercise 6

Do not use the DepDelay variable when making predictions.
